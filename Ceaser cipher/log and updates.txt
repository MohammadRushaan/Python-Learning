Hello 

This is a log file for the Caesar cipher program.

Scalability and Improvement scope:
		Add support for numbers, special characters, eventually ASCII. This will teach character encoding 
		Modular arithmetic, Edge-case handling.
		Instead of two separate logics , a single function with mode choice between encrypt and decrypt
		Variable and Dynamic shift
		Input/output upgrades
		Modular design by splitting into classes
		making it a library
		Add a CLI
		Add logging and error handling
