7 jan 2026 : I made a Caesar Cypher program which i practised using Freecodecamp ,
            I accidentaly created a 2nd branch master and pushed to that , issue was 
            that my local repo didnt have main derived from my github which i resolved 
            and managed to solve the issue , and then cleared of master branch , this 
            taught me error handling and branch divergence in Github , Also updated Readme 
            and added this log file to keep a record of changes that i am making.

            made a Rpg character stat display pattern program that inputs character name
            , strength, intelligence, charisma(rizz), as stats and based on certain 
            limitations , sets boundaries and then , to display the result in a special 
            formatted manner, 
            concepts used:
            functions
            condintionals
            list comprehension
            output formatting
            user inputs

            special thanks to my better half ChatGPT 😅, who helps me learn

8 Jan 2026 : I added my projects into their seperate folders so that i could manage 
            each project in a version wise manner , keeping track of project wise 
            changes and improvements as i progress with my programming knowledge 
            adding new features , This way all project changes are recorded in a 
            neat manner and i can also add versions without deleting the previous 
            one.

            Created a new CountDown Timer program , that takes seconds input from usser
            and then runs the timer , I learned the use of python modules and plan to 
            learn more of them they are basically predefined local APIs .
            This program taught me:
            Time module usage and utilising its functions to count CountDown
            formatting output 
            new techniques through vs code autocomplete
