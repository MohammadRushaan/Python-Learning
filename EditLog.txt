7 jan 2026 : I made a Caesar Cypher program which i practised using Freecodecamp ,
            I accidentaly created a 2nd branch master and pushed to that , issue was 
            that my local repo didnt have main derived from my github which i resolved 
            and managed to solve the issue , and then cleared of master branch , this 
            taught me error handling and branch divergence in Github , Also updated Readme 
            and added this log file to keep a record of changes that i am making.

            made a Rpg character stat display pattern program that inputs character name
            , strength, intelligence, charisma(rizz), as stats and based on certain 
            limitations , sets boundaries and then , to display the result in a special 
            formatted manner, 
            concepts used:
            functions
            condintionals
            list comprehension
            output formatting
            user inputs
